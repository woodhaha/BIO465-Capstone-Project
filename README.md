# BIO465-Capstone-Project
Capstone Project for BIO 465. Research based on Gross et al. (2014). Finding significant interactions in breast cancer samples.

## Instructions

Please run the following scripts in order:

1. `download_datasets.R`
2. `filter_samples.R`

After running these two scripts, a `Data` directory will be created. This directory will hold the raw data as well as filtered datasets which include only the sample IDs which are common across the three datasets: phenotype data, mutation data, and copy number data.
